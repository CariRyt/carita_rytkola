    <h2>Wolf</h2>

    The wolf (Canis lupus[b]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.
     More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly understood,
      comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae.
       It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, 
       as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species,
        such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled
        white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.

    <h1>Origin of the domestic dog</h1>
    <p>
        <img style="float: right;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Canis_lupus_howling_on_glacial_erratic.jpg/600px-Canis_lupus_howling_on_glacial_erratic.jpg">
        The origin of the domestic dog includes the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication,
         and the emergence of the first dogs. Genetic studies show that all ancient and modern dogs
          share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf population - 
          or closely related wolf populations - which was distinct from the modern wolf lineage.[3][4]
           The dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf is the result of substantial dog-into-wolf gene flow,[3]
            with the modern grey wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.[5]
         An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog.[5][1][6]</p></article>
